## Course 1

### Introduction to SQL

When it comes to extracting insights from stored data, SQL is one of the most versatile tools available. Learn how to execute core SQL commands to define, select, manipulate, control access, aggregate and join data and data tables. Understand when and how to use subqueries, several window functions, as well as partitions to complete complex tasks. Clean data, optimize SQL queries, and write select advanced JOINs to enhance analysis performance. Explain which cases you would want to use particular SQL commands, and apply the results from queries to address business problems.

### Course Project: Deforestation Exploration
SQL is most commonly used to manipulate and analyze data to inform decision making. In this project, you will act as a data analyst for an organization on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this important environmental topic. First, youâ€™ll clean any erroneous values in a table, join that table to another lookup table to bring in a new categorical and quantitative variable, and return a new view of all categories greater than a reference value. Then, you will create and execute SQL queries to perform calculations using variables from those disparate data sets to answer questions for stakeholders. Your analysis will help you better understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size, and also which countries and regions have the most significant forest area. Lastly, you will
compile your answers and summarize your analysis into a report that can be shared to a leadership team.
